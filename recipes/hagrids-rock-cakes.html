    <p>Hagrid had one hell of a sweet tooth. 
    <br> A rock cake or a rock bun is a traditional 
    <br> British cookie, a cookie so easy to make 
    <br> even a 5-year-old could make it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients
    </h3>
<h5>Produce</h5>
<ul><li>4 1/3 oz 125 g chopped dried fruit</li>
</ul>
<h5>Refrigerated</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 Egg</li>
</ul>   
<h5>Baking & Spices</h5>
<ul>
    <li>8 1/8 oz 230 g all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp Allspice, ground</li>
    <li>1 1/4 tsp Baking powder</li>
    <li>100 g Muscovado sugar</li>
    <li>1 pinch Nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
</ul>
<h5>Dairy</h5>
<ul>
    <li>4 1/4 oz 120 g unsalted butter, unsalted</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 180 degrees Celsius/ 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix</strong> the flour, sugar, baking powder, allspice, salt, and nutmeg. Add the soft butter and rub it into the flour with your hands until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Chop</strong> the larger dried fruit, if using. Sultanas, raisins or cranberries can be left whole.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Beat the egg lightly in a small bowl. Stir the chopped fruit and egg into the flour-butter mixture with your hand or a spoon.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide the dough</strong> into 10 heaps and place the heaps on the prepared baking tray. You should not try to give them a nice shape, leave them rough so that they can resemble rocks in the end.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake</strong> for about 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Leave to cool on the baking tray for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store airtight.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>
